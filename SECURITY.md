# Security Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the application to ensure data protection, user privacy, and system integrity.

## Security Measures

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- Multi-factor authentication (TOTP and WebAuthn/Passkeys)
- Row-Level Security (RLS) for database access control
- Session management with secure cookies
- Account lockout after multiple failed attempts

### 2. Data Protection
- TLS/SSL encryption for all data transmissions
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt
- Database encryption for sensitive data
- Automatic RLS context management

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- Comprehensive input validation for all user inputs
- HTML sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Content validation for uploaded files

### 4. Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

### 5. Rate Limiting & Brute Force Protection
- IP-based rate limiting for all endpoints
- Stricter limits for authentication endpoints
- Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- Automatic blocking of suspicious activity

### 6. Logging & Monitoring
- Comprehensive security event logging
- Standardized log format for security events
- Log rotation to prevent disk space issues
- Suspicious activity monitoring

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Always use parameterized queries for database operations
2. Apply input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
3. Use the security middleware for all new endpoints
4. Log security events appropriately
5. Follow the principle of least privilege

### For Administrators
1. Regularly review security logs
2. Keep all dependencies updated
3. Perform regular security audits
4. Maintain proper backup procedures
5. Monitor for suspicious activity

## Security Testing
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing before major releases
- Code security reviews
- Dependency vulnerability checks

## Incident Response
In case of a security incident:
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Assess the scope and impact
3. Contain the breach
4. Eradicate the vulnerability
5. Recover systems
6. Document the incident and response
7. Implement preventive measures
